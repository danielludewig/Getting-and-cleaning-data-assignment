Codebook

Results are broken up into a number of factors. 
“Acc” denotes the result comes from the accelerometer, while “ Gyro” denotes the result comes from the gyroscope. 
The “t” prefix denotes the result is in the time domain, while the “f” prefix denotes a result in the frequency domain. 
Signals are also separated into body and gravity acceleration signals, with “Body” and “Gravity” being used to denote each.  
“Jerk” is used to denote signals obtained by the body linear acceleration and angular velocity being derived in time. “Mag” is used to denote the calculated magnitude of these signals. 
“X”, “Y” and “Z” are used to identify which axis the signal measurement is on. 

All signals are the averaged results of a single subject repeating an identical activity. 

A full list of the variables is featured below.
